## ‚ú® Demo & Usage
        1. Execute Competition_Details.ipynb,Complexes_Details.ipynb,venues_details.ipynb,Competitors_Details.ipynb,Competitor_Rankings.ipynb,sql_queries.ipynb,Streamlit.py
        2. Execute the above files in local postgresql or use cloud streamlit
        3. If using Streamlit cloud, enable those connections in the python files.
        4. Added the passwords in the secrets.toml folder (for cloudDB) and Added the passwords in the pwd.toml folder (for local DB)
                     project directory like this:
                         ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85c5adfc-17d6-4c35-bc1c-254792c64439)

                     Inside secrets.toml/pwd.toml:
                         host = "localhost"
                         user = "youruser"
                         password = "yourpassword"
                         database = "yourdb"
                         port = "5432"
         5. To Set secrets in Streamlit Cloud UI:
                 Go to Streamlit Cloud.
                 Open your deployed app.
                 Click the ‚ÄúManage app‚Äù button (bottom right).
                 Go to the ‚ÄúSecrets‚Äù tab.
                 Add your secrets in the following format:
                                 host = "your-db-host"
                                 user = "your-db-user"
                                 password = "your-db-password"
                                 database = "your-db-name"
                                 port = "5432"
         6. Using Render for PostgreSQL database deployment and hosting. Those connections I have been using in the Streamlit Cloud
